# Rotko Networks Peering Policies

Welcome to Rotko Networks' Peering Information page. Our network's peering strategy
is meticulously designed to enhance routing efficiency and optimize connectivity
based on strategic geographical positioning and substantial security priorities.
This ensures robust and resilient network performance globally.

## Community Structure

Our advanced community tagging strategy employs a precise numbering system to
identify and prioritize routes effectively. This system enhances traffic management
by aligning it closely with geographic relevance and connectivity requirements.

### Local Routing within Thailand

- **`142108:000-099`** - Dedicated to local routes within Thailand, enhancing domestic data flow:
  - `142108:010` - Direct peers in major Thai cities.
  - `142108:020` - Critical infrastructure and essential service providers.
  - `142108:030-099` - Expansive coverage for other local ISPs and networks.

### Key Internet Exchange Points

- **`142108:010`** - BKNIX, Bangkok: Central to our local peering, facilitating efficient regional exchange.
- **`142108:011`** - AMSIX Bangkok: A pivotal hub for enhancing connectivity within and beyond Southeast Asia.
- **`142108:210`** - AMSIX Singapore: Supports robust peering for Singapore, reflecting its status as a critical gateway to Southeast Asia.
- **`142108:310`** - AMSIX Hong Kong: Serves as a primary node for traffic exchange in East Asia.
- **`142108:1010`** - AMSIX Amsterdam: Our European gateway, ensuring comprehensive connectivity across the continent.

### Regional and International Routing

- **`142108:100-199`** - Addresses non-submarine cable-accessible countries neighboring Thailand:
  - `142108:110` - Laos
  - `142108:120` - Cambodia
  - `142108:130` - Myanmar
  - `142108:140-199` - Reserved for future expansion and detailed regional specificity.

- **`142108:200-999`** - Comprehensive coverage for APNIC regions, with specific
allocations for significant internet exchanges like Tokyo (`142108:410`) and Seoul (`142108:420`).

- **`142108:1000-1999`** - Routes to non-APNIC regions, ensuring global reach and
connectivity with substantial allocations for regions like Europe (`142108:1100`) and North America (`142108:1100`).

## Routing Policy

### Commitment to Security and Efficiency

Rotko Networks adheres to a rigorous routing policy designed to secure and optimize our network infrastructure:
