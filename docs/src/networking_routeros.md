# RouterOS

RouterOS is an operating system designed specifically for routers and network
devices. Developed by the Latvian company MikroTik, it is used to turn standard
x86-64 architecture computers or MikroTik's own RouterBOARD hardware into fully
functional routers.

RouterOS provides all the core features expected in a router, such as routing,
firewalling, bandwidth management, VPN support, and more. Here's a brief
overview of some key features and aspects:

1. **Routing**: Supports various routing protocols such as BGP, OSPF, RIP, and
   MPLS, allowing for robust and scalable network design.

2. **Firewall**: RouterOS includes a powerful firewall to secure the network.
   It allows for filtering by IP address, port, protocol, and other parameters.

3. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Bandwidth management is a strong feature in
   RouterOS, enabling administrators to prioritize certain types of traffic,
limit bandwidth for specific users, or guarantee certain bandwidth levels for
specific services.

4. **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support**: RouterOS supports various VPN
   protocols, including OpenVPN, L2TP, PPTP, and SSTP, allowing secure
connections to remote networks.

5. **Wireless Capabilities**: It provides support for various wireless
   standards, making it suitable for creating Wi-Fi hotspots or linking
locations wirelessly.

6. **User Management**: RouterOS offers multiple user levels and authentication
   methods, such as local database, RADIUS, and more.

7. **Hotspot Gateway**: It allows the setup of a custom user login page,
   authentication of users, and bandwidth limitation, particularly useful in
public Wi-Fi scenarios like hotels, airports, etc.

8. **Winbox**: RouterOS can be managed through Winbox, a GUI application
   provided by MikroTik, as well as through command line and web interfaces.
Winbox enables an easy-to-use interface for configuring and monitoring the
router.

9. **Scalability**: Suitable for small home setups and also for large
   enterprise networks. It provides robust features that can be tailored to fit
various network sizes and requirements.

10. **BGP Routing**: Regardless of being small vendor MikroTik RouterOS
    supports BGP routing protocol and has its security features implemented in
    better than larger vendors.

11. **Scripting**: RouterOS includes a scripting language that lets
    administrators automate various functions and operations.
    Also SSL secured API available.

13. **Updates and Security**: Regular updates are provided by MikroTik,
    including security patches and feature enhancements.

RouterOS makes a compelling choice for network professionals who need an
affordable and highly configurable operating system for their routers. It can
transform simple hardware into powerful network devices with an extensive range
of features. Whether deployed in small businesses, large enterprises, or ISPs,
RouterOS is a versatile solution to many networking needs.
