# Energy Consumption and Carbon Offset

## Energy Consumption

Energy consumption is a crucial aspect of our operations, especially concerning
our server infrastructure. This energy powers everything from the cooling
systems that keep our servers at optimal temperatures, to the computational
processes that enable our systems to run.

We have strategically chosen to utilize low TDP processors for our server rack
to maximize energy efficiency. Our server rack comprises 2x AMD Ryzen 5600G
processors, 1x AMD Ryzen 5950X (170W TDP), and 1x AMD Ryzen 5950X3D (120W TDP).
This processor selection provides an excellent performance-to-power ratio and
fits within the power limit of our 4kWh server rack.

Given these processors are running at full load 24/7, the total monthly energy
consumption can be estimated as follows:

Total Power: 2 * 65W (5600G) + 170W (5950X) + 120W (5950X3D) = 420W Conversion
to kW: 420W / 1,000 = 0.42 kW Monthly Energy Consumption: 0.42 kW * 24
hours/day * 30 days/month = 302.4 kWh

Given Thailand's average emissions factor from 2021 of about 0.55 kg CO2e per
kWh, this monthly energy consumption translates to roughly 166.32 kg CO2e, or
about 0.166 metric tons (mt) of CO2e.

Please note that these figures are estimates and the actual energy consumption
and carbon emissions may vary depending on the actual server load and the
current energy mix of the grid.

## Carbon Offset

To counterbalance the environmental impact of our energy consumption, we are
committed to minimizing and offsetting our carbon emissions. We have chosen to
offset our carbon emissions through a monthly subscription with TerraPass.

TerraPass offers Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) which contribute towards
clean energy projects like wind and solar farms. By purchasing these RECs, we
balance the carbon footprint of our monthly electricity use.

TerraPass's project portfolio includes Landfill Gas Capture, Farm Power, Clean
Energy from Wind Farms, and Abandoned Coal Mine Methane projects. The offsets
from these projects are registered under the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) or
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), ensuring transparency and quality.

The funds collected through our monthly subscription will be directed to these
projects, contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and
supporting the generation of renewable energy.

## Moving Forward

Our commitment to transparency and accountability in our climate actions
involves regular monitoring, measurement, and reporting on our energy usage and
carbon emissions. We are dedicated to continuously exploring and implementing
strategies to reduce our environmental impact and providing updates about our
carbon offset initiatives to our stakeholders.

Our aim goes beyond merely offsetting our carbon emissions. We are driven to
build a sustainable and resilient organization that contributes positively to
our planet and society. Our actions today set the stage for a more sustainable
future and we are proud to be part of the solution to climate change.

## Carbon Offset Plan

We understand that achieving sustainability and minimizing our environmental
footprint involves more than just reducing our energy consumption. It also
requires active measures to offset the carbon emissions we do produce. To this
end, we've chosen to partner with TerraPass to implement an effective carbon
offsetting strategy.

Taking into account our estimated monthly emissions of 0.166 metric tons (mt)
of CO2e, we've decided to go above and beyond in our commitment to
sustainability. We have opted for TerraPass's Renewable Energy Certificates
(RECs) monthly subscription, specifically their 1 MWh/month plan.

This plan costs Â£12.00 per MWh per month and the funds collected are directed
towards supporting clean energy projects like wind and solar farms. By choosing
this plan, we are not only offsetting our emissions but also actively
supporting the development and utilization of renewable energy.

By subscribing to this plan, we are effectively offsetting more carbon
emissions than we produce, a strategy known as 'over-offsetting'. The decision
to 'over-offset' aligns with our commitment to being a positive force for
environmental change and goes above and beyond our responsibility to simply
neutralize our carbon footprint.

We believe this proactive approach to carbon offsetting sends a strong message
about our dedication to sustainability. It's not just about doing less harm,
but about doing more good, and taking concrete steps to foster a healthier
planet. We are not only committed to offsetting the carbon emissions from our
operations, but also to contributing positively to the environment and the
ongoing transition to renewable energy.
