# Energy Consumption and Carbon Offset

## Relocating to a Greener Data Center

We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint, and as part of that journey,
we have relocated to a new data center at STT. This move is crucial to aligning
with our environmental goals, as the STT data center is on track to achieve full
carbon neutrality by 2030. The facility is already implementing 100% carbon
offsetting measures, making it an essential step in our decarbonization strategy.

### Current Energy Consumption

Our current infrastructure consumes **595.1 kWh per month** per rack, reflecting
the continuous optimization of power usage.

* **Monthly CO2e Emission Estimate:**
  * Thailand's 2021 CO2 emission factor: **0.563 kg CO2e/kWh**
  * Monthly emissions: `595.1 kWh * 0.563 kg CO2e/kWh = 335 kg CO2e` or
  **0.335 metric tons (mt) CO2e** per month.

By relocating to STT's greener facility and leveraging their renewable energy
and offset programs, we are significantly reducing our carbon emissions, making
our operations more eco-friendly and sustainable.

## Carbon Offset Strategy

In line with our sustainability commitments, we previously offset our carbon
emissions through Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) via TerraPass. With the
relocation to the STT data center, we are now focusing more on reducing the
emissions directly, while still engaging in over-offsetting strategies to cover
any residual emissions.

## Conclusion

The transition to the STT data center marks a new chapter in our sustainability
efforts, combining energy-efficient infrastructure with a comprehensive
offsetting plan. By continually optimizing our energy consumption and utilizing
greener facilities, we are advancing towards our goal of a carbon-neutral future.
