### Energy Consumption and Carbon Offset

**Energy Consumption**

Energy is vital to our operations, specifically in our server infrastructure.
We've opted for low TDP processors in our server rack for increased efficiency,
using 2x AMD Ryzen 5600G, 1x AMD Ryzen 5950X, and 1x AMD Ryzen 5950X3D. This
results in an excellent performance-to-power ratio within our 4kWh server rack.

* **Monthly Energy Consumption Estimate:**
  * Total Power: 420W (2 * 65W + 170W + 120W)
  * Monthly: 0.42 kW * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 302.4 kWh
  * CO2e Emissions (Thailand's 2021 average): 166.32 kg or 0.166 metric tons
  (mt)

**Carbon Offset**

To mitigate our environmental impact, we're offsetting our carbon emissions
through a monthly subscription with TerraPass, purchasing Renewable Energy
Certificates (RECs) for clean energy projects. These offsets, including
Landfill Gas Capture and Wind Farms, are under reputable standards like the
Climate Action Reserve (CAR).

**Moving Forward**

We're committed to transparent and accountable climate action, continuously
striving to reduce our environmental impact and informing stakeholders of our
efforts. Our goal transcends merely offsetting emissions; we're building a
resilient, sustainable organization contributing positively to our planet.

**Carbon Offset Plan**

Achieving sustainability requires active offsetting. We've partnered with
TerraPass, choosing their 1 MWh/month RECs subscription for Â£12.00 per MWh,
exceeding our estimated emissions of 0.166 mt of CO2e. This 'over-offsetting'
strategy supports renewable energy projects, reflecting our dedication to
environmental change.

In conclusion, our approach to energy consumption and carbon offsetting aligns
with our commitment to environmental responsibility and innovation. By actively
engaging in sustainable practices, we contribute not only to offsetting our
carbon emissions but to the broader goal of a cleaner, greener future.
