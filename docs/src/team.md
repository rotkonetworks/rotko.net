Tommi is a symbol of the generation that mastered the qwerty keyboard even
before grasping the intricacies of handwriting. With over 20 years of
experience in building hardware, software, and managing servers during the
early stages of the internet, he demonstrates an exceptional commitment to
the digital world.

Tommi's journey with Bitcoin started as early as 2008. He ran the first
version of Bitcoin on a Pentium D950 computer, only to lose the digital keys
within a few months. This experience gave him a first-hand insight into the
workings of the novel digital currency.

However, it wasn't until 2013, when Snowden's revelations and the growing
influence of anonymous online marketplaces came to light, that Tommi fully
grasped the importance of Bitcoin's proposition. The internet, once thought
of as a user-driven landscape, had allowed a mere ten companies to gain
majority control, leading to concerns about mass surveillance.

This eye-opening realization led to the creation of Rotko Network. This
initiative is based on the principle of creating an internet that is shaped
by its users, rather than dominated by a few profit-driven corporations. With
the dedication of a software enthusiast and the heart of a freedom-fighter,
standing at the helm of this mission. He is dedicated to end the data
slavery and reshaping the internet into a space that truly belongs to its
users.
